    	<li>Prof Gaine's will give extra credit for those who show up and show they care. Great teacher and he wants his students to pass. Gives homework every week.</li>
    	<li>This is the best math professor I had ever, I strongly recommend him. he is funny and helpful, he goes over the materials aas many as you need it. The best!!!!!!</li>
    	<li>Prof. Gaine is really funny, makes the class interesting. Gives some homework and 3 exams, the second test was a take home. I hate math and he made it easy for me I was able to understand the material. He is patient if you don't get it he would go over it 20 times if you asked. He is a great professor, there should be more math prof like him.</li>
    	<li>Too much handsomeness for one semester! This professor is the best I have ever had for any class. Very clear, understandable, fun and helpful. As long as you show up and participate you will LEARN the material and pass the class. I am terrible at math and for once in my life I had a professor that truly helped me learn the material.</li>
    	<li>Professor Gaine is Smart and Knowledgeable! He knows math and how to teach it well. Always willing to go over the work and offers office hours to go over the work and tutor his students as needed. Professor is one of the best at Lehman. Would definitely take him again.</li>
